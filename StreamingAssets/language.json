    "tt_2_2": "To break that GLUCOSE, you'll need to absorb OXYGEN particles first.",
    "tt_2_3": "Good job! Now you have gathered both GLUCOSE and OXYGEN.",
    "tt_2_4": "Lastly, you'll need to put your cells under a beam of light. This process is called PHOTOSYNTHESIS.",
    "tt_2_5": "Perfect! Now, let's see how can you do it in this wild tiny world!",

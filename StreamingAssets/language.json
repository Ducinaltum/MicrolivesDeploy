    "levelwin_3": "Well done! You are a expert on animal cells!",
    "gamewin": "Superb! Now you know a lot more about cells. Congratulations!",
    "stagelose": "Oh, no! It´s not easy to get by in this tiny world",
    "levelsaveopt_1": "Those mean viruses... But don't worry!",
    "levelsaveopt_2": "Maybe, if you can answer this question you can get back in a flash to keep those cells growing!",

    "tt_2_2": "To break that GLUCOSE you'll need to absorb OXYGEN particles first",
    "tt_2_3": "Good job! Now you have gathered both: GLUCOUSE and OXYGEN",
    "tt_2_4": "Lastly, you'll need to put your cells under a beam of light, this process is called PHOTOSYNTHESIS",
    "tt_2_5": "Perfect! Now, let's see how can you do it in this wild tiny world!",
